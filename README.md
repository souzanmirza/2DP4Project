#2DP4 Project: Sound Digitization and Transmission
###### This repository includes the files for my microcontroller's class final project.


##Description:
This objective of this project was to design a system which read in audio samples from an electret microphone and read and display them on a computer. The electret microphone was given a constant tone input which was conditioned and then sent to Esduino to be digitized and serially transmitted to a Matlab program which polls the serial transmission and plots the waveform for a short period of time.

The CodeWarrier IDE was used to program the Esduio and Matlab was used to read in and display the data.
